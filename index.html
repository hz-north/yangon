            The name <span>Yangon</span> is derived from the combination
            of the Burmese words yan and koun, which mean <span>'enemies'</span> and <span>'run out of'</span>,
            respectively. This word combination can be translated as 'End of Strife'.

          <h2 >Yangon</h2>
          <p data-hidden> was founded as Dagon in the early 11th century by <span class="mini-text">the Mon people,</span>
            who inhabited Lower Burma at that time.
      
          <p data-hidden>Dagon became an important pilgrimage pagoda town, starting in the 14th century, during 
            <span class="mini-text">the Hanthawaddy Kingdom.</span>
          </p>
          <p >Notable governors of Dagon included Princess Maha Dewi, who ruled the town from 1364 to 1392, 
            and her grandniece, <span class="mini-text">Shin Saw Pu,</span> who later became 
            <span class="mini-text">the only female queen</span> regnant in Burmese history.
          </p>
          <p data-hidden>The <span class="mini-text">British</span> captured Yangon and all of Lower Burma 
            in the Second Anglo-Burmese War of 1852, and subsequently transformed Yangon 
            into the commercial and political hub of British Burma.
          </p>
          <p data-hidden>After the war, the British moved the capital of British Burma from 
            <span class="mini-text">Mawlamyine</span> to <span class="mini-text">Yangon.</span>
          </p>
          <p data-hidden> Yangon became <span class="mini-text">the capital of all British-ruled Burma</span> 
            after the British had captured Upper Burma in the Third Anglo-Burmese War of 1885.
